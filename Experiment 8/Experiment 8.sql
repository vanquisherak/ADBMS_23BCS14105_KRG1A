---------------------------TRANSACTION IN SQL--------------------------- 
/* 

- Whenever we perform any operation (CRUD) inside the database, these operations are treated as TRANSACTIONS. - Also known as T-SQL. 

*/ 
-- 1. T-SQL - transaction is a single unit of work. 
-- 2. TCL - TCL commands COMMIT and ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINTS 
-- 3. Discuss ACID Properties 
-- 4. Transactions are merged at Connection(Query File is known as connection) Level. 

/*
Quick conceptual recap (ACID)

Atomicity — a transaction is “all or nothing”.

Consistency — DB moves between consistent states.

Isolation — concurrent transactions don’t interfere (controlled by isolation level).

Durability — once committed, changes persist.

PostgreSQL defaults to autocommit on — each SQL statement is a transaction unless you start an explicit one with BEGIN.

-- each statement commits automatically (default nature)

--Explicit Transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;  -- start transaction

INSERT INTO student(name, age, class) VALUES ('Rohit', 17, '10th');
COMMIT; -- make all changes permanent


--COMMIT
BEGIN;

COMMIT;

--ROLLBACK
BEGIN;

ROLLBACK;  -- undoes the insert


--What happens when a statement fails inside a transaction?

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO student(name, age, class) VALUES ('Alice', 18, '10th');
-- this will fail because name must be unique ('Alice' already exists)
INSERT INTO student(name, age, class) VALUES ('Alice', 19, '11th');
-- After the second INSERT error, the transaction is aborted.
SELECT * FROM student;  -- ERROR: current transaction is aborted ...
ROLLBACK;               -- required to reset the session transaction state



--SAVE POINTS IN TRANSACTIONS

/*
A SAVEPOINT creates a named rollback point inside an open transaction so you can undo part 
of the work (with ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT) without aborting the whole transaction.


----------------------Why savepoints?-------------------------

- Transactions are atomic: either everything in the transaction succeeds (commit) 
or everything fails (rollback).

- But sometimes you want: do steps A, B, C; if B fails, undo only B and continue with C and 
then commit everything that’s still valid.

- Savepoints let you implement that: they provide partial rollback inside a transaction.

--SYNTAX:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;                       -- start transaction
SAVEPOINT sp_name;                       -- create a savepoint
-- SQL QUERIES
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sp_name;           -- undo all changes after sp_name
RELEASE SAVEPOINT sp_name;               -- remove the savepoint (optional)
COMMIT;                                  -- commit the transaction


/*
RELEASE SAVEPOINT deletes the savepoint; it does not commit anything.

All savepoints are cleared when the outer transaction ends (commit or rollback).

------------------------------Experiment 08-------------------------------
---------------------Hard Level Problem-----------------------------
/*
Design a robust PostgreSQL transaction system for the students table where multiple student records are inserted in a single transaction. 
If any insert fails due to invalid data, only that insert should be rolled back while preserving the previous successful inserts using savepoints. 
The system should provide clear messages for both successful and failed insertions, ensuring data integrity and controlled error handling.
