Create a large dataset: 
   - Create a table names transaction_data (id , value) with 1 million records.
	- take id 1 and 2, and for each id, generate 1 million records in value column
   - Use Generate_series () and random() to populate the data.
2. Create a normal view and materialized view to for sales_summary, which includes total_quantity_sold, total_sales, and total_orders with aggregation.3. Compare the performance and execution time of both.*/

/*HARD
The company TechMart Solutions stores all sales transactions in a central database.A new reporting team has been formed to analyze sales but they should not have direct access to the base tables for security reasons.The database administrator has decided to:

Create restricted views to display only summarized, non-sensitive data.

2. Assign access to these views to specific users using DCL commands (GRANT, REVOKE).*/
